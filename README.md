## 5 Project features:
- First of all all packages for the website have been installed by tailwind css , daisyUI and router.

- Normally there are six sections on the home page and one section is Feature Food and one is our Team and another is Frequently Asked Questions.

- There will be a details button on the feature food where you can click on the food request and see your own food requests in a round.

- Important thing here is that only those who are logged in can use the bio details button and can use other features.

- In the final you can request your donation from here and your username and profile will be shown.
