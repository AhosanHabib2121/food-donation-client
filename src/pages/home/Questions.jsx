                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content"> 
                    <p>Volunteers in the warehouse assist with building grocery bags, organizing produce, repackaging food items, sorting through food donations, assembling grocery boxes for seniors, and many other projects.

                    At Food Pantries, volunteers set up and distribute groceries, and clean up the site. You should expect to lift up to 30 pounds repeatedly and interact with participants receiving their groceries.

                    Shop Floor volunteers maintain, stock, and rotate the inventory and provide customer service to Shop Partners as they select groceries for soup kitchens, after school programs, etc.

                    Home-Delivered Groceries volunteers use their own car to drop off fresh groceries to participants.

                    Check out detailed information about all these volunteer opportunities above.</p>
